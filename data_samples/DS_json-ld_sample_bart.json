The matter was later resolved and Lota went on to play for the former.Upon leaving FC Sion, Lota joined Orlando Pirates where his prowess in front of the goal and particularly his celebration (rubbing his palms against each other), earned him the nickname \"Chesa Mpama\" (loosely translated as \"hot slap\" in Zulu, one of the 11 official languages in South Africa.
