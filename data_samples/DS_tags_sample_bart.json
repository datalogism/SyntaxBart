His initial exposure came through the viral success of his song videos uploaded to YouTube. Puth initially signed with the record label eleveneleven after performing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, while songwriting and producing for other artists. With primary intent on a solo career, Atlantic Records and Artist Partner Group eventually sought the artist, and he released his debut single, \"Marvin Gaye\" (featuring Meghan Trainor), in 2015. He was then featured on the single \"See You Again\", which he co-wrote, co-produced, and performed with Atlantic label-mate Wiz Khalifa for the Furious 7 soundtrack as a tribute to actor Paul Walker. The song peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks, was certified 11\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA, and earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song nomination, along with three nominations at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, including one for Song of the Year. After the success of \"See You Again\", he gained worldwide recognition for multiple subsequent releases, including his next single, \"One Call Away\". The single reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. Puth's debut studio album, Nine Track Mind, was released in January 2016 to moderate commercial success and generally negative critical reception. The album included the single \"We Don't Talk Anymore\" (featuring Selena Gomez), which peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2017, he released two songs, \"Attention\" and \"How Long\", with the former peaking at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Both were included on his second studio album, Voicenotes (2018), which received generally positive critical reception and peaked at number 4 on the Billboard 200. In 2019, Puth released the singles \"I Warned Myself\", \"Mother\" and \"Cheating on You\". The following year, Puth released singles \"Girlfriend\" and \"Hard on Yourself\". After deciding not to put these songs on his next album and scrapping what other songs he had written for it in early 2020, Puth released \"Light Switch\" in January 2022 as the lead single of his upcoming third studio album Charlie, which is scheduled for an October 2022 release.
